# Asset Tracking API

## Overview

This project is a solution to the Asset Tracking API exercise. It is built using Java 17, Spring Boot, and DynamoDB, with a caching layer implemented using Redis. The API allows querying and retrieving GPS coordinate data for simulated vehicles over a given time range.

This program includes `src/test/java/com/example/assettracking/DataToDynamoDB.java` class for data integration. We are using `data.json` file to insert the data, and we are also modifying the `createdAt` field by converting the ISO string to a Unix timestamp in milliseconds. The long fields provide better performance for sorting and searching operations.

We are also using caching to improve performance.

## Features

- Retrieve all events for a given asset and time range
- Query a single event by its ID
- Return the latest event for all assets
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Caching with Redis to improve performance
- Effective indexing in DynamoDB for optimized queries

## Technical Details

### Caching

The API uses Redis for caching frequently accessed data. The following methods are cached:

- `getEventsByAssetAndTimeRange`
- `getEventById`
- `getLatestEvents`

Caching helps to reduce the load on DynamoDB and improves the response times for frequently accessed data.

### Technical Depth

#### Pagination Support

Pagination is implemented at the database level to handle large datasets efficiently. This is crucial when dealing with high volumes of data, as it prevents loading the entire dataset into memory, thereby improving performance and reducing latency.

To implement pagination, the API leverages the Pageable interface from Spring Data, which allows specifying page number and size parameters. This enables clients to retrieve a subset of data at a time. By passing these parameters to DynamoDB queries, we ensure that only a limited number of records are fetched per request. This approach minimizes the amount of data transferred and processed, making the API more responsive.

Effective partition keys and secondary indexes further enhance the efficiency of paginated queries. Partition keys distribute the data across different partitions, allowing DynamoDB to process requests in parallel and improve read/write throughput. Secondary indexes, on the other hand, enable querying non-primary key attributes, which is essential for filtering and sorting data within paginated requests.

#### Indexing in DynamoDB

Indexing in DynamoDB is a critical aspect of optimizing query performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. In this project, we use a Global Secondary Index (GSI) on the `asset` and `createdAt` attributes.

A GSI allows for efficient querying by enabling queries on attributes that are not part of the primary key. By indexing the `asset` and `createdAt` attributes, we can quickly retrieve events for a specific asset within a given time range, which is a common query pattern for this application.

Here's an overview of how the GSI is configured:

- **Index Name**: `AssetCreatedAtIndex`
- **Partition Key**: `asset` (String) - This attribute is used to group related items together.
- **Sort Key**: `createdAt` (String) - This attribute is used to order items within a partition, allowing efficient range queries.

The GSI configuration improves read performance by reducing the number of items DynamoDB needs to scan, thus lowering query latency and increasing throughput. However, there is always room for optimization. Periodic reviews of the indexing strategy, based on actual query patterns and access frequencies, can further enhance performance. This may include adding more indexes or adjusting existing ones to better match the application's needs.

#### Improved Architecture Design

Currently, the API retrieves the latest asset event directly from the database. While this approach works, it can lead to high I/O operations, especially under heavy load, affecting performance and scalability.

To address this, an improved architecture design can be implemented using a Pub/Sub model or a queuing mechanism to keep the latest data in the cache. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Event Listener**: A service that updates events can include an event listener. This listener subscribes to updates and changes related to asset events.
2. **Cache Updater**: The listener updates the cache with the latest events. This can be done using a time-based sliding window, where the last 5 minutes to 1 day of data is kept in the cache.
3. **Cache Retrieval**: The API retrieves the latest events directly from the cache, reducing the number of database I/O operations significantly.

By caching the latest events, the system can serve these frequently accessed data points much faster. This not only improves response times but also offloads the read burden from DynamoDB, allowing it to handle other critical operations more efficiently.

Implementing this architecture requires careful consideration of cache eviction policies, data consistency, and the design of the event listener to ensure it scales with the application's load. However, the benefits in terms of performance improvements and reduced database load are substantial.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are written using JUnit and Mockito. To run the tests:

```sh
mvn test
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for querying events by trip ID
- Implement additional caching strategies
- Enhance error handling and validation
